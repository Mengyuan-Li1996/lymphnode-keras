lymph node
-------------

This project aims to use deep learning approaches to capture intersting histopathological changes in cancer-free lymph nodes for breast cancer patients. We have developed a segmentation pipeline to capture and quantify a set of immune features.


Todo
-------------

* improve sinus and germinal predictions
* weakly supervised approaches
* weighted map for sinuses (uncertain/fuzzy annotations)
* deep reinforcement learning - image segemntation
* transfer learning unet
* random conditional forest
